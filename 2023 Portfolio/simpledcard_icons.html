          <p>Simpledcard requested custom icons to use on their website, marketing materials and other platforms. They wanted modern, professional, vector-based icons that matched their branding. The icons needed to be optimized for web and mobile, eye-catching and memorable, and delivered in a variety of formats.

        <h2>Custom icons per topic</h2>
        <p>Every icon was carefully crafted to perfectly represent its topic. Every detail was carefully thought out, from the shape and size to the colors and shadows. Every icon was designed to make the topic easily recognizable and stand out from the rest. All icons were made to be unique and custom to each topic.

        <h2>Grid-based icons</h2>
        <p>Grid-based icons are designed to provide consistent visuals across all use cases. Icons are created using a grid system, which ensures that each icon is of the same size and shape. This ensures that all icons look the same, no matter where they are used. This consistency makes grid-based icons an ideal choice for web and mobile applications.
