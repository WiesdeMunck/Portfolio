          <p>GENTS asked me to make an ad for their new clothes line. I brainstormed & sketched to come up with a
            concept that was creative & unique. The ad had to be eye-catching & stand out in the competitive market.
            After some work, I created an illustration that met their needs.</p>

        <h2>Adding new elements</h2>
        <p>I was tasked with creating line illustrations of GENTS' clothing line that were minimal yet distinct. I had
          to imagine each item in a visual form and keep them different enough from each other so the customer could
          easily tell the difference between items.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Adding a dynamic touch</h2>
        <p>At first, I proposed making only static clothing illustrations. However, I suggested adding a more dynamic
          option that would make the ad more visually appealing, yet still fit the current styling and so the man in  the suit was born.

        <h2>Posters in stores</h2>
        <p>The posters and designs I made are distributed in 20 stores across the Netherlands. I have been designing
          advertisements for GENTS since 2015, starting as an intern before obtaining a part-time job, then
          transitioning to freelance work.
