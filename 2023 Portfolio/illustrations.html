          <p>To increase my capabilities in illustrating, I would periodically choose a subject and create an illustration of it. These subjects could range from Family Guy to No Lines to Chibi.

        <h2>The drunken knight</h2>
        <p>For this illustration, I chose the body of the character Peter Griffin from the TV show Family Guy as the context. His armor was slowly built upon by adding bits and pieces. His pose was thought of beforehand.

        <h2>The fabulous unicorn Steve</h2>
        <p> The context of the illustration I created was a person with a broken arm being healed by a fabulous unicorn. I had to ensure that the artwork met the style rules of featuring line work. To achieve this, I took multiple pictures of myself to use as a pose and then went to work tracing and merging different pictures.

        <h2>The Chibi knight</h2>
        <p>This illustration depicts a warrior battling a pack of wolves, but being too high-level to get hit. This happend in a game of dnd  I played with my friends. The style chosen was Chibi, a more cute style with an oversized head.
